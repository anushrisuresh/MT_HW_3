what has happened here , last Tuesday , honourable Senate ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended a meeting of the first to committee . 
some of the Senate committee and I do not know what it really surprised admits that independent . 
i am not so that concern for the time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
over the next two years in the work that undertaking a senator . 
it is important to a committee , as some of those senators , supposedly new Senate committee which actually sitting . 
i am therefore to note that one of the Senate committee was introduced in the last sitting of the nine to attend . 
it was sent a replacement . 
i honourable name , not individual senators . 
you can see that it does so , I am not nice ? 
that was the fault will have to find in their own research senators . 
one must accept the , a job when they do . 
the women who have proven sitting on the Senate . 
the majority of the Senate in that duty they will be better remplissaient men . 
i remember that the committee held in February of veterans of the to hold - 1998 . 
then it is the House of Commons or sitting in the Senate Ni . 
the Liberals have all of the Senate committee sat in the proceedings of women , three . 
the committee were to find the leadership of the Senate is a man . 
to answer the question I asked , what I could cite the words , hon. senator Carstairs took word . 
the criteria are as follows : " I asked was Quels ? " 
she said that it was the first report of women in the address in a representation . 
it was struck by the parliamentary associations that in 1993 . 
at the time of men were only formées delegations Les . 
i have been replaced by on this matter , for a number of years in the Senate Finestone . 
however , I will look back the opportunity of my association preferred . 
i do not know how to this honourable House , when the decision or two reports will be senators . 
the verdict is that each on television senators . 
by a or any group of students , or to journalists wondered . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if it in a position to a committee , he should participate or any meetings accepts an existing senator . 
we must not be in the members of the corridors said : 
there is a committee to study the today and in committee , when you two years in the final question " Présentez '' . 
they do not know what they are not even out to them , but when they stand considers stand their leaders . 
they do not know what happened no . 
the words " '' , " and " in the Senate is our commitment to continuité speech honourable way . 
in the coming weeks and how we will look at the beginning to address both the independent senators . 
if we do not do business in my own who are concerned about the parliamentary committee , I créerai international . 
we try to no one can . 
the Honour the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure to rise and , if you will adopt the motion , like any other hon. Senator honourable Senate ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
